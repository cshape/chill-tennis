  <h1>Chill Tennis</h1>
    <p>Tennis is a wonderful game to play with friends. But it's not much fun if you can't keep a rally going.</p>
    <p>Most casual players jump too quickly into games and don't give themselves a chance to get a good foundation. This leads to frustration down the line, as you won't improve.</p>
    <p>Work with Cale to improve your game in a fun, low-pressure ("chill") environment, and then wow your friends the next time you go play!</p>
